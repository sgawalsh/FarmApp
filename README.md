# FarmApp
Farming simulation strategy game intended as a demonstration of OOP principles.

The player runs "app.py" and can either choose to start a new game, or load up a saved game in "saves.p". The player can save and quit the game and load up that file at any point during the game. Upon completion of the game, if the player completed the game fast enough, their name will be added to the leaderboard and will live on in eternal glory.

The game is a turn-based strategy economy game in which the player buys and upgrades aspects of their farm in order to increase their revenue. The game is won when the player's bank reaches $10 000. Reaching $10 000 in the fewest turns gets you a high score.
